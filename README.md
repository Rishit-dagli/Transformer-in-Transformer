An Implementation of the [Transformer in Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00112)
paper by Han et al. for image classification, attention inside local patches.
**Transformer in Transformers** uses pixel level attention paired with patch
level attention for image classification, in TensorFlow.

## Installation

Run the following to install:

```sh
pip install tnt-tensorflow
```

## Developing tnt-tensorflow

To install `tnt-tensorflow`, along with tools you need to develop and test, run the following in your virtualenv:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/Transformer-in-Transformer.git
# or clone your own fork

cd tnt
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Usage

```py
import tensorflow as tf
from tnt import TNT

tnt = TNT(
    image_size=256,  # size of image
    patch_dim=512,  # dimension of patch token
    pixel_dim=24,  # dimension of pixel token
    patch_size=16,  # patch size
    pixel_size=4,  # pixel size
    depth=5,  # depth
    num_classes=1000,  # output number of classes
    attn_dropout=0.1,  # attention dropout
    ff_dropout=0.1,  # feedforward dropout
)

img = tf.random.uniform(shape=[5, 3, 256, 256])
logits = tnt(img) # (5, 1000)
```
